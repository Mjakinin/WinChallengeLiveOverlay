# WinChallenge Overlay

**WinChallenge Overlay** is a lightweight tool for gaming sessions, allowing players to track challenges and sync progress in real time.

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Server

The host must start the server by running the following command in the terminal/console:

```bash
python server.py
```

### 2. Connect Clients
Each player opens the **client.exe** file located in the `dist` folder. This launches the overlay with the current list of challenges.

> **Note:** Make sure all clients are connected to the server before starting the session.

### 3. You're Ready to Go!
Once all players are connected, the session can begin. The overlay will automatically synchronize the checklist across all clients.
